# Embedding Adapters

## About

This repository implements an embeddings' adapter layer (fine-tuning on embeddings). It investigates the impact of fine-tuning on embeddings in RAG models.

## Important Files

-   `notebooks/synthetic-data.ipynb`: This notebook contains the generation of synthetic data for fine-tuning the embeddings' adapter layer.
-   `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb`: This notebook contains the evaluation of the embeddings' adapter layer on the RAG model.
-   `notebooks/train.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training of the embeddings' adapter layer on the RAG model.
-   `globals.json`: This file contains the global variables used in the notebooks.
