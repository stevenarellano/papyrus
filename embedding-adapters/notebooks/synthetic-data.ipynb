NavGPT is a vision-language navigation system that employs an LLM to trans-\\nlate visual inputs from a visual foundation model (VFM) into natural language. The LLM\\nthen interprets the current state and makes informed decisions to reach the intended goal,\\nbased on these converted visuals, navigation history, and potential future routes. NavGPT\\nconducts various functions, including high-level planning, decomposing instructions into\\nsub-goals, identifying landmarks in observed scenes, monitoring navigation progress, and\\nmodifying plans as necessary. Although NavGPT’s performance on zero-shot tasks from\\nthe R2R dataset has not yet matched that of trained models, it underscored the potential\\nof utilizing multi-modality inputs with LLMs for visual navigation and tapping into the\\nexplicit reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enhance learned models.\\nHuang [175] introduced VLMaps, a spatial map representation that integrates pre-\\ntrained vision-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical world.
