# Running the code

Before running the code, you must first start a virtual environment and install the required packages, which will be installed in the `requirements.txt` file. To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can run the juptyer notebooks as you would normally.
